    * **Pros:** High speed, lightweight, excellent for close-range battles

**Now for the Clips**

**Keep those darts coming with the right clip:**

* **Clip System:** Most modern blasters use a clip system, making reloading quick and efficient. 

    * **Pros:** Fast reloading, secure hold on darts, easy to store extra clips
    * **Cons:** Some blasters can only use specific clips

* **Drum Magazines:**  Ideal for high-capacity blasting, drum magazines hold a whopping amount of darts.

    * **Pros:** Massive dart capacity, no need to refill frequently
    * **Cons:** Can be bulkier to carry, may not work with all blaster models
