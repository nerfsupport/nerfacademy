## Keep Your Squad Organized: Best Storage Ideas for NERF Blasters

A serious NERF warrior needs a serious battle plan, and that includes **organized storage** for their arsenal. 

From bulky blasters to dart packs, NERF gear can quickly take over your space.  

Fear not, fellow blaster enthusiasts! We've compiled some awesome storage solutions to keep your collection in tip-top shape and ready for action.

**1.  Wall-Mounted Organization:**

* **Pegboards:** Use pegboards with hooks and pegboard accessories to hang blasters, darts, and accessories. This creates a visually appealing display and maximizes wall space.
* **Hanging Shelves:** Install shelves specifically designed for NERF blasters. Many online retailers offer shelves with compartments that accommodate various blaster sizes. 

**2.  Crate and Container Solutions:**

* **Plastic Storage Bins:** Use clear or colored plastic bins with labels for easy identification. Different sizes can house various blaster types and accessories.
* **Wooden Crates:**  Add a touch of rustic style with wooden crates. Opt for crates with dividers to separate blasters and prevent damage during transport.
* **Drawers:**  Utilize dresser drawers or modular drawer units to store blasters vertically. This conserves space and protects them from dust and damage.


**3.  DIY Delights:**

* **Repurposed Furniture:** Give old furniture a new life!  Bedside tables, bookshelves, or even empty filing cabinets can be transformed into awesome NERF storage solutions.
* **PVC Pipe Rack:** Create a custom blaster rack using PVC pipes and connectors. This is a sturdy and affordable option that can be easily customized to fit different blaster sizes.
* **Shoe Organizer:**Believe it or not, over-the-door shoe organizers are perfect for storing dart clips, tactical vests, and smaller accessories.

**Tips for Optimal Storage:**

* **Clean your blasters before storing them:** This prevents dirt and debris from accumulating and causing damage.
* **Store darts separately:** To avoid accidental discharge, keep darts in separate containers or bags.
* **Choose a cool, dry location:** Avoid storing NERF blasters in direct sunlight or humid environments.
* **Label your containers clearly:** This will help you quickly find what you're looking for during battle prep.


With a little creativity and organization, you can keep your NERF collection safe, accessible, and ready for epic battles!
