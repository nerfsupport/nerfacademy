**For the Tots (Ages 3-6):**

* **Foam ammo is key:** Choose blasters that fire softer, larger foam darts designed for younger kids. 
* **Easy loading:**  Opt for blasters with simple priming mechanisms and large, easy-to-handle barrels.

* **Nerf Dart Tag Blaster:**  Classic dart tag action with bright colours and unique darts.

**For the Rising Stars (Ages 7-10):**

* **Introduce more blaster types:**  Expand your arsenal to include  buzz blasters, clip-fed pistols, and single-shot rifles.
* **Longer range and capacity:**  These kids are ready for more complex blasters with increased range and dart capacity.

**Recommended:**

**For the Nerf Masters (Ages 11+):**

* **High-performance:**  Think flywheel blasters with high velocity and extended range.
* **Customizable:**  Explore blasters with attachments like lasers, scopes, or extra magazines.
* **Team play:**  Consider blasters that can build upon each other or offer tactical advantages in larger groups.

**Recommended:**
